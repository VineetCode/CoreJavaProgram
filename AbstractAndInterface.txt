Interface with Default Methods
====================
1. Inside interface every variable is always public static final and there is no chance of instance variables.
2. Interface never talks about state of object.
3. Inside interface we can’t declare constructors.
4. Inside interface we can’t declare instance and static blocks.
5. Functional interface with default methods Can refer lambda expression.
6. Inside interface we can’t override object class methods.

Abstract Class
============
1. Inside abstract class there may be a chance of instance variables which are required to the child class.
2. Abstract class can talk about state of object.
3. Inside abstract class we can declare constructors.
4. Inside abstract class we can declare Instance and static blocks
5. Abstract class can’t refer lambda Expressions.
6. Inside abstract class we can override object class methods.
